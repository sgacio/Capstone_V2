Coffee Clicker is a remake of the idle game Cookie Clicker.

The game works by having a player accumulate "coffees" by clicker a button. Each click of the button grants the player 1 coffee. As the player gathers more "coffees" they can use said "coffees" to purchase in game items which grant passive "coffees" per second. The player must balance clicking the button and purchasing in game items in order to collect as many "coffees" as possible.
